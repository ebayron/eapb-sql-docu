			<P>Allows you to automatically send transaction log backups from a primary database on a primary server instance to one or more secondary databases on separate secondary server instances.</P>

				<H3>Requirements:</H3>

					<OL>
						<LI>Database must reside on the same domain.</LI>
						<LI>Both server instance must have the same server collation settings.</LI>
						<LI>SQL server agent should be configured to start up automatically.</LI>
						<LI>Backup and Restore folders must be created separately with appropriate permissions.</LI>
							<BR /><IMG SRC="IMG/02.PNG" WIDTH=40% /><BR />						
						<LI>Database must be in Full or Bulk Recovery model.</LI>
						<LI>Account must have sysadmin privileges on each computer running SQL server to configure log shipping.</LI>
					</OL>
			
				<H3>Transaction Undo File</H3>
				
					<UL>
						<LI>.TUF is created when performing log shipping to a server in Standby mode.</LI><BR />
						<LI>When the database is in Standby mode, the database recovery happens when the log is restored; and this mode also creates a file on destination server with .TUF extension.</LI><BR />
						<LI>This file contains information on all modifications performed at the time backup is taken.</LI><BR />
						<LI>While restoring, the log backup all uncommitted transactions are recorded to the undo file with only committed transactions written to disk which enables the users to read the database.</LI><BR />
						<LI>When we restore next transaction log backup, SQL Server will fetch all the uncommitted transactions from undo file and check with the new transaction log backup whether committed or not.</LI><BR />
						<LI>If found to be committed the transactions will be written to disk - else it will be stored in undo file until it gets committed or rolled back.</LI>
					</UL>
			
			<H2 ID="Configuration">Configuration</H2>

				<OL>
					<LI>Perform one Full Backup and one Transaction Log Backup on the database.</LI><BR />
					<LI>Restore the back up files on the secondary server with NO RECOVERY option.</LI>
					
						<P>
							We can set it to either NO RECOVERY or STANDBY.
							Both options leaves the database in a state where it can continue replaying transaction log files.
							With NO RECOVERY, it leaves the database not accessible.
							With STANDBY it leaves the database in read-only. It creates this extra standby file with an extension of bak.
							In previous versions of SQL Server, this used to be a TUF file.
							It still serves the same purpose - it contains the information on modifications made as part of any incomplete transactions at the time the backup was made.
						</P>

					<LI ID="DatabaseProperties">Go to the primary database's properties and go to Transaction Log Shipping section. Check the "Enable this as a primary database in a log shipping configuration" option.</LI><BR />

								<P>When configuring a Log Shipping, there are three jobs that will be created.</LI>

									<OL>
										<LI>A job in the primary server that will back up the transaction logs.</LI>
