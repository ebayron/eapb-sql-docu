			<H2>Overview</H2>
			
				<UL>
					<LI>Refers to the logical model of a replication topology.</LI>
					<LI>Each one offers additional configuration options that allows you to have more granular control over how data gets from source to destination and what happens to it when it gets there.</LI>
					<LI>Consideration for the different replication types is based on the way the data is going to be used and how important it is that the data be current.</LI>
					<LI>Two key terms to remember when choosing a replication type are autonomy and latency as there is a direct correlation in each replication types available.</LI>
					<LI>When choosing a replication strategy, you must have a solid understanding of how the data will be used. Consider the following:</LI>
						<UL>
							<LI>Do the users need access to up-to-the-minute data, or can they work with data that is provided on a regular schedule but may be several hours old (or older)?</LI>
							<LI>Do the users need to be able to make changes to the data, and should those changes be synchronized with the original source material?</LI>
							<LI>Will the data originate from a single source, or will multiple sources be used to provide data to a centralized database?</LI>
						</UL>
				</UL>
				
			<H2 ID="SnapshotReplication">Snapshot Replication</H2>
			
				</BR><IMG SRC="IMG/003.jpg" WIDTH=80% /></BR>

				<UL>
					<LI>Creates an identical copy of the replicated objects and their data each time it runs.</LI>
					<LI>The Publisher sends a snapshot of the published data to Subscribers at scheduled intervals.</LI>
					<LI>Every time this replication runs, all articles and their data are again copied from scratch, overwriting any external changes that might have been applied to the target database, which can require significant bandwidth and storage resources.</LI>
					<LI>Rather than providing updates on a transaction-by-transaction basis, snapshots of the entire article are taken at the publisher periodically and then applied to the subscriber as a unit.</LI>
					<LI>This replication uses SQL Server's bcp utility to write the contents of each table into the snapshot folder.</LI>
					<LI>When a snapshot is generated, it is saved as a file to a file system that must be accessible to the publisher, the distributor, and the subscriber.</LI>
					<LI>If all the components reside on the same server, which may sometimes be the case if you’re using replication to populate a separate database on the same server, specify a local file system path for the snapshot location.</LI>
					<LI>
						During initial setup, all other replication types use, by default, a single replication snapshot to sync the Publisher to its Subscribers. The benefit of this is for asynchronous environments where there can be a delay between the publisher and subscriber.
						However, because the snapshots are copied and applied each time replication occurs, it can be prohibitively resource-consuming for large amounts of data. There are options to compress the snapshot files, as well as to help reduce disk usage and transfer times between the distributor and subscriber, though.</LI>
					<LI>As with Transactional Replication, Snapshot Replication also supports the use of immediate or queued updating subscriptions.</LI>
					<LI CLASS="error">When creating a succeeding snapshot, it creates the new snapshot before deleting the old one. (<EM>One incident happened where disk space was a problem and business process cannot ammodate this immediately, the solution applied was since the new snapshot was already created, the old snapshot was replaced with a new file - same name and but 0 in size just to let SQL Server finish.</EM>)</LI>
					<LI>Re-initialization also makes use of this infrastructure.</LI>
				</UL>

			<H2 ID="TransactionalReplication">Transactional Replication</H2>
			
				</BR><IMG SRC="IMG/004.jpg" WIDTH=80% /></BR>

				<UL>
					<LI>Has the lowest latency and autonomy among other replication types.</LI>
					<LI>Uses the log files associated with the source database to keep data in sync.</LI>
					<LI>Synchronization can be scheduled.</LI>
					<LI>Sensitive to external changes to the target database. Any such change can potentially break replication so the target database should be considered read-only.  There are exceptions to this rule, however. For example, objects can be modified in the target database that are not part of the replication setup.</LI>
					<LI>Uses a Snapshot Agent, a Log Reader Agent and Distribution Agents. The Snapshot Agent and the Log Reader Agent reside on the Distributor. The Distribution Agent, however, can live either on the Distributor or the Subscriber, depending on the subscription model.</LI>
					<LI>For this replication to work, every table that are published must be configured with a primary key.</LI>
					<LI>Each transaction that changes one or more of these objects is recorded in the log. The information required to replay those changes is then made available to the Subscribers so they can apply the changes to their copy of the published objects.</LI>
					<LI>Data Flow:</LI>
						<OL>
							<LI>Begins with a snapshot of the data that will be used as a baseline for further transactions to be applied against.</LI>
							<LI>Publisher streams transactions to the Subscribers after they receive an initial snapshot of the published data.</LI>
							<LI>As transactions are committed, those that apply to data that participates in this replication are copied to the distribution database on the distributor.</LI>
							<LI>Then the subscribers can receive the transactions and apply the changes to the copied data.</LI>
						</OL>
				</UL>

				<H3>Standard Transactional Publication</H3>

					<UL>
						<LI>Used when the subscriber accepts the publication for Read-Only use.</LI>
						<LI>This prevents the subscriber from being able to update the data on the publisher, but does not prevent clients from updating data on the subscriber itself. For example, a remote server may use the replicated data in conjunction with SSRS to provide access to historical and trend data, and modifications may be made locally, but no changes can be submitted at the remote server that will be accepted at the original publisher.</LI>
						<LI>For other variants of Transactional Replication see <A HREF="Others.html#OtherVariantsofTransactionalReplication">here</A>.</LI>
					</UL>
					
			<H2 ID="MergeReplication">Merge Replication</H2>
			
				</BR><IMG SRC="IMG/005.jpg" WIDTH=40% /></BR>

				<UL>
					<LI>The Publisher and Subscribers can update the published data independently after the Subscribers receive an initial snapshot of the published data.</LI>
					<LI>It allows two or more databases to be kept in sync.</LI>
					<LI>Changes are merged periodically.</LI>
					<LI>
						It was designed to allow for data changes on the Publisher as well as the Subscriber, but it also allows for disconnected scenarios.
						For example, if a Subscriber is disconnected from a Publisher during part of the day, the Subscriber and Publisher are synchronized when they are reconnected.</LI>
					<LI>It is used in environments where data entry tasks may be performed independently of one another, and users or applications periodically need to connect to synchronize data.</LI>
					<LI>It introduces a number of changes to the publishing databases that are used for tracking and synchronization. This includes:</LI>
						<UL>
							<LI>Additional column (uniqueidentifier column configured with the ROWGUIDCOL property and a unique index) to published tables used for tracking. That change can potentially break existing code accessing those tables. It will also increase the size of the table by at least 16 bytes per row. If you ever drop the Merge Publication, every uniqueidentifier column that was automatically added to its articles will be removed automatically as well. This has the potential of breaking any code that was written after replication was established and that now relies on those columns being there.</LI>
							<LI><MARK>Manually add UNIQUEIDENTIFIER columns before setting up Merge Replication.</MARK> That way, DBA will have full control over the columns and if when they get dropped.</LI>
							<LI>Additional tables and triggers that are used to store row history data for published rows.</LI>
						</UL>
					<LI>
						It utilizes a set of triggers to identify articles that have changed and to record those changes.
						These elements are designed to be unobtrusive, and the triggers created by replication will not affect any user-defined triggers that you have created.</LI>
					<LI>
						It offers both a blessing and a curse with its ability to handle synchronizations from multiple subscribers.
						Its blessing comes from the ability to grant users offline access to data sets that are critical to their needs.
						Its curse comes from the fact that multiple offline subscribers may be trying to synchronize different changes to the same data.</LI>
					<LI>
						The Change Tracking mechanism used by this replication allows users to define how conflicts are resolved between multiple subscribers.
						For example, a particular subscriber may be given more weight than others, and, therefore, its changes should be considered authoritative.</LI>
					<LI>There are also mechanisms to programmatically build more complex resolvers. This allows you to create more granular rules about conflict resolution, giving priority to certain subscribers only if specific criteria are met.</LI>
					<LI>The Merge Agent applies the collected changes to the Subscriber. It also applies changes to the Publisher as required.</LI>
					<LI>Setup requires the ff:</LI>
						<UL>
							<LI>Articles in a publication reside in a single database.</LI>
							<LI>However, it is possible to define different publications on different databases or even multiple publications on the same database.</LI>
							<LI>Same article can be included in more than one publication.</LI>
						</UL>
					<LI>Unlike Transactional Replication which makes use of the transaction log to replicate data changes to the Subscribers, this replication does not keep a record of the changes but instead works with the data in the published tables when the synchronization is performed.</LI>
					<LI>This helps to reduce the storage requirements on each server while being disconnected from the rest of the replication setup. However, it does introduce some storage overhead and inflexibility, because there needs to be a way to identify records that changed between synchronizations.</LI>
					<LI>Because data can be modified on both the Subscriber and Publisher, it's possible for a row to be updated in two different places at the same time, which can result in data being in conflict. This replication comes with several built-in options to help resolve such conflicts.</LI>
					<LI>Because this replication permits data to flow from the Publisher to the Subscriber and vice-versa, the same set of objects is also added to each subscription database.</LI>
					<LI>When you run the replication setup wizards, SQL Server automatically creates the necessary Merge Replication agents, the SQL Server Agent jobs that run those agents, and the set of triggers, tables, and views that the agents use. These objects are added to each subscription database as well as to the publication database.</LI>
					<LI>Replication defines three triggers on every published table. These triggers are responsible for recording every change that is applied to the data in the published tables. The triggers conform to this naming convention: MSmerge_???_FA62745126C46858453EEF185F94618. The long hexadecimal number at the end of the name is the internal article identifier. The question marks (???) serve as a placeholder for one of the following three values:</LI>
						<UL>
							<LI>del (for delete trigger)</LI>
							<LI>ins (for insert trigger)</LI>
							<LI>upd (for update trigger)</LI>
						</UL>
					<LI>Replication also creates the following database triggers to capture any schema changes to the published articles:</LI>
						<UL>
							<LI>MSmerge_tr_alterschemaonly</LI>
							<LI>MSmerge_tr_altertable</LI>
							<LI>MSmerge_tr_altertrigger</LI>
							<LI>MSmerge_tr_alterview</LI>
						</UL>
					<LI>The changes recorded by the triggers are not applied to the Subscribers right away. Instead, data that can be used to identify which records and columns changed is stored in replication metadata tables in the database in which the change happened. The names of all these tables begin with MSmerge_.</LI>
					<LI>Replication also creates several system views that follow the same naming pattern. These views are used by the internal Merge Replication processes.</LI>
					<LI>The Merge Agent lives on either the Distributor or the Subscriber, depending on the subscription model.</LI>
				</UL>
				
			<H2 ID="OracleReplication">Oracle Replication</H2>

				<UL>
					<LI>This requires at least SQL Server 2005 and Oracle 9i, but replication will support any Oracle publisher, regardless of the underlying platform.</LI>
					<LI>Snapshot Replication from an Oracle database operates similarly to SQL Server snapshots.</LI>
					<LI>The Snapshot Agent connects to the Oracle publication and retrieves rows and creates schema scripts for each published table.</LI>
					<LI>As with SQL Snapshot Replication, the entire data set is created each time the table is run.</LI>
					<LI>Unlike homogeneous SQL Server Transactional Replication (which monitors the transaction log for changes), Transactional Replication for Oracle requires that changes be made to the Oracle database by creating tracking tables and triggers.</LI>
					<LI>When changes to a published Oracle table are made, the triggers fire and insert the changes into the tracking table. This is like the behavior seen in Merge Replication.</LI>
					<LI>SQL Server, again acting as the distributor, executes the Log Reader Agent to move the changes from the tracking table to the distribution database. The distributor then provides the changes to the subscribers as would be expected.</LI>
