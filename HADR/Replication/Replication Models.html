					<LI>Any of the replication types can use any of the replication models.</LI>
					<LI>Another consideration when choosing an appropriate replication model is whether to have the publisher and the distributor on the same instance.</LI>
					<LI>Geographical distribution and network availability may influence decision to use a local distributor versus a remote one.</LI>

						<LI>This can be useful in applications in which the local database stores information about local and remote operations.</LI>
						<LI>Each publisher can provide updates made locally to all other replication partners that participate in this model and receive the updates, in turn.</LI>
