				<UL>
					<LI>While it's possible to set up replication outside of a domain, it is not recommended. However, if forced to work outside of a domain, ensure that each user account used for replication exists on every machine and is configured with the same password, instead of existing just on the domain controller.</LI>
					<LI>To set up replication, configure the Distributor, create a publication, and then a subscription.
					<LI>To see the difference between push and pull subscriptions, the Distributor and Subscriber must be on different machines.</LI>
					<LI>Combining two or more machines can hide mistakes that don't show up unless replication is set up on separate machines.</LI>
				</UL>

					<UL>
						<LI>Same system collation settings between the servers.</LI>
						<LI>Same Local windows groups and SQL Server Login definitions on both servers.</LI>
						<LI>External software components are installed on both servers.</LI>
						<LI>CLR assemblies deployed on the publisher are also deployed on the subscriber.</LI>
						<LI>SQL agent jobs and alerts are present on the subscriber server, if these are required.</LI>

									<LI>Being on a Distributor's access list does not make a server a Publisher. It merely grants the server access to that Distributor.</LI>
									<LI>If the Distributor is just being set up, the list will contain only the Distributor itself when the page first appears.</LI>
									<LI>The local instance is always pre-selected in this list. That is due to the fact that a SQL Server instance that is set up to be a Distributor can use only itself as a Distributor for publishing.</LI>

						<LI>In Object Explorer of the SQL Server instance that will be assigned as a Publisher, expand the Replication folder, right-click Local Publication, and then click New Publication to launch the New Publication Wizard.</LI>

						<LI><B>Publication Database</B> - Select a database. There will be a note advising that not all databases might be included in the list. If this is the case, then <A HREF=".\Others.html#EnablingaDatabaseforReplication" target="_blank">enable the database for replication in the publisher</A>.</LI>
							
						<LI><B>Publication Type</B> - Select Snapshot Publication. If you are not a member of the db_owner role, you might see an error like below. It means that the selected database is not enabled for the type of replication selected.</LI>
							
							<BR /><IMG SRC="IMG/026.PNG" WIDTH=50% /><BR />

						<LI><B>Articles</B> - It lists all objects that can be replicated. Choose which articles should be part of the publication (<MARK>if you are just doing a standard/simple set-up, you can proceed on Snapshot Agent section</MARK>).</LI>
							
							<BR /><IMG SRC="IMG/027.PNG" WIDTH=50% /><BR />
									
							<UL>
								<LI>Associated with each article is a set of properties that can be viewed or reconfigured.</LI>
								<LI>
									To access the properties associated with an object, select an object in the Objects to publish list, and then click the Article Properties button.
									This opens a drop-down list that lets you choose between showing the Article Properties dialog box for the highlighted article only, or showing the dialog box for all table articles in the publication.</LI>
								<LI>The second option allows you to change the properties of all articles of a single type (the type of the highlighted object) in one shot.</LI>
							</UL>

							<BR /><IMG SRC="IMG/028.PNG" WIDTH=50% /><BR />

							<P>
								The list of properties changes depending on the type of article selected.
								For example, depending on the article, you can specify the name of the target object, what to do if the target object already exists, whether to replicate each stored procedure execution along with the definition, etc.
							</P>

							<P>
								When configuring the properties of an article, you will have the ability to specify the schema options that determine whether or not partitioned objects are copied to the subscriber.
								This can be done through the New Publication Wizard, the Publication Properties dialog, or through the schema_option parameter of the sp_addarticle, sp_addmergearticle, sp_changearticle, or sp_changemergearticle stored procedures.
								In case that data needs to be moved between partitions, these changes can also be published using Transactional Replication.
								By default, SWITCH PARTITION operations are blocked when a table is enabled for replication, but partition switching can be manually enabled if it is needed.
							</P>
							
							<P>
								When you highlight a table that is selected as an article, the "Highlighted table is download-only" option appears beneath the Article Properties button.
								If you select this option, changes to the table's data are not permitted on the Subscriber.
								You should select this option for any table that contains data that should not be changed on the Subscriber(s).
								This selection causes significantly less data to be collected on the Publisher because there is no need to maintain data to help resolve conflicts.
								Not permitting changes to the replication data on the Subscriber side can therefore have a dramatic impact on performance and space requirements on the Publisher.
								You can also set this option in the article's properties.
							</P>
		 
							<P>Synchronization direction property supports the following three settings:</P>

								<OL>
									<LI>Bi-directional</LI>
									<LI>Download-only to Subscriber, allow Subscriber changes</LI>
									<LI>Download-only to Subscriber, prohibit Subscriber changes.</LI>
								</OL>

							<P>
								The "Highlighted table is download-only" option essentially lets you toggle between the first and the last setting.
								If you were to manually select the second setting, changes on the Subscriber would be allowed, but would not be transferred back to the Publisher and might be overwritten.
								The fact that this option has a single check box alternative on the Articles page of the wizard shows the importance of selecting the appropriate setting for your articles.
							</P>
		 
							<P>
								For table articles, there is one more option to be aware of.
								There is an option to choose to publish the entire table or a subset of columns within that table.
								By clicking the plus sign next to a table in the Objects to publish list, you can expand the table node to display the table's columns.
							</P>

							<BR /><IMG SRC="IMG/030.PNG" WIDTH=30% /><BR />

							<P>
								Here, you can select individual columns to be replicated or to be excluded (vertical filter).
								In Transaction Replication, when selecting columns to be replicated, always include the primary key.
								All other columns can be omitted.
							</P>

							<LI>
								<B>Article Issues</B> - Depending on the type of articles you selected, you might see this page.
								It warns of potential issues that could arise from the selection.
								It does not mean that there is a problem.
								It only points out areas that often cause problems later.
								If it appears, make sure to look thoroughly through each point listed and then make the necessary changes, if any.

							It appears only if selected at least one table article.
						</LI>

							<BR /><IMG SRC="IMG/032.PNG" WIDTH=70% /><BR />
		 
							<P>
								The dialog box creates a filter that specifies which rows to replicate in the selected table article (horizontal filter).
								This looks like a SELECT statement that includes a WHERE clause.
								After the WHERE keyword, specify the clause's condition.
								This uses significant additional resources because every row that was changed on a filtered article has to be inspected to see whether or not it matches the filter.
							</P>

						<LI><B>Snapshot Agent</B></LI>

							<BR /><IMG SRC="IMG/033.PNG" WIDTH=50% /><BR />
							
							<P>
								If setting up a publication that has only one Subscriber, create the snapshot immediately.
								On the other hand, if needed to resynchronize multiple Subscribers often, consider setting up the agent to refresh the snapshot regularly to work with fresh data.
								Because of the impact that taking a snapshot can have, it might be a good idea to schedule it to run during off-hours instead of right away.
							</P>

						<LI ID="AgentSecurity">
							<B>Agent Security</B> – Specify the account to use to run the Snapshot Agent.
							Using the SQL Server Agent service account is not a recommended security best practice.
							Also, it is a general security best practice to have each Windows service or service-like executable run under its own Windows account.
							That way, grant just the minimal set of required permissions to each account.
							That practice greatly reduces the surface for a potential malicious attack.
							It also reduces the amount of damage that can be done should an attack be successful.
							The replication agents run automatically and unattended.
							Therefore, each one should be given its own account to run under.
						</LI>

							<BR /><IMG SRC="IMG/034.PNG" WIDTH=70% /><BR />
		 
							<P>
								The "Connect to the Publisher" section of this page specifies how the agent should connect to the publisher.
								After selecting the account and connection settings for the agent, the next step is to grant the appropriate permissions to each applicable Windows account and SQL Server login.</P>
							
								<UL>
									<LI>You must make the Windows account assigned to the Snapshot Agent a member of the db_owner fixed database role in both the publication database and in the distribution database.</LI>
									<LI>The account also needs to have write permission on the snapshot folder.</LI>
								</UL>

							<P>
								When setting up the Snapshot Agent to not use integrated security to connect to the publication database, but instead use SQL Server authentication, the provided SQL Server login also needs to be a member of the db_owner fixed database role in the publication database.
								In that case, the Snapshot Agent Windows account itself does not need to have access to the publication database.
								To ensure the necessary access rights, configure accounts as follows:</P>

								<UL>
									<LI>A SQL Server login must be associated with the Windows account used on both the Distributor and the Publisher.</LI>
									<LI>The distribution and publication databases must each include a user that is associated with the login.</LI>
									<LI>Each user must be member of the db_owner fixed database role in that user's database.</LI>

								You can assign a priority value between 0 and 99.99 to a Server Subscriber.
								The value determines how Subscribers are prioritized in the event of a conflict.
								In general, higher values win over lower values.
								Note, however, that these priority-based conflict resolution rules apply only to articles for which the default conflict resolver is selected.
								Because you cannot specify a priority for a client, the Priority for Conflict Resolution text box is read only.
