				<H3>Cluster validation: "The servers are not all in the same organizational unit"</H3>

					<P><B>Problem:</B> ..among the warnings that the cluster validation wizard points out is this one in the Active Directory section: The servers are not all in the same organizational unit..I don't know is whether this is a problem for the purposes of clustering. Is it perfectly fine to set up the cluster this way, or should I have the client make some AD changes?</P>
					<P><B>Solution:</B> The implications are that there is the potential for group policy, or other processes that rely on the OU structure in AD, to make non-uniform changes to cluster members. Best practices are to have them in the same OU, and it only takes a moment to correct, so ask your client to move them into the same OU. Also, Microsoft also supports Failover Clusters only when the cluster passes all validation tests.</P>
