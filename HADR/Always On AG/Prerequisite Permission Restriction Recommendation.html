						<LI>If you destroy and re-create a WSFC, you must disable and re-enable AG feature via SQL Server Configuration Manager on each server instance.</LI>
						<LI>
							Each server instance requires a database mirroring endpoint.
							Note that this endpoint is shared by all the availability replicas and database mirroring partners and witnesses on the server instance.
							If a server instance that you select to host an availability replica is running under a domain user account and does not yet have a database mirroring endpoint, the New AG Wizard (or Add Replica to AG Wizard) can create the endpoint and grant CONNECT permission to the server instance service account.
							However, if the SQL Server service is running as a built-in account, such as Local System, Local Service, or Network Service, or a non-domain account, you must use certificates for endpoint authentication, and the wizard will be unable to create a database mirroring endpoint on the server instance.
							In this case, we recommend that you create the database mirroring endpoints manually before you launch the wizard.</LI>
						<LI>Other Notes:</LI>
							<UL>
								<LI>If any databases that use FILESTREAM will be added to an AG, ensure that FILESTREAM is enabled on every server instance that will host an availability replica for the AG.</LI>
								<LI>If any contained databases will be added to an AG, ensure that the contained database authentication server option is set to 1 on every server instance that will host an availability replica for the AG.</LI>
								<LI>If you use TDE, the certificate or asymmetric key for creating and decrypting other keys must be the same on every server instance that hosts an availability replica for the AG.</LI>

							<UL>
								<LI>If you add an availability replica on an FCI, the WSFC nodes that are possible FCI owners cannot host another replica for the same AG. To avoid possible conflicts, it is recommended to configure possible owners for the FCI. This will prevent potentially causing a single WSFC from attempting to host two availability replicas for the same AG.</LI>
								<LI>Using the Failover Cluster Manager to move a FCI hosting an AG to a node that is already hosting a replica of the same AG may result in the loss of the AG replica, preventing it from being brought online on the target node.

						<LI>There must be 2 networks for each node - 1 for external and 1 for internal (heartbeat) - each have different subnet masks. FCI or AG can be set up without hearbeat, but it is a bad practice to do so. If the network is congested, the node will not be able to communicate and the cluster will failover.</LI>							
						<LI>External and internal network must have different subnet masks. If the network is congested, the node will not be able to communicate and the cluster will failover.</LI>							
						<LI>
							It is recommended to use the same network links for communications between WSFC nodes and communications between availability replicas.
							Separate network links can cause unexpected behaviors if some of links fail (even intermittently).
							For example, for an AG to support automatic failover, the secondary replica that is the automatic-failover partner must be in the SYNCHRONIZED state.
							If the network link to this secondary replica fails (even intermittently), the replica enters the UNSYNCHRONIZED state and cannot begin to resynchronize until the link is restored.
							If the WSFC requests an automatic failover while the secondary replica is unsynchronized, automatic failover will not occur.</LI>
