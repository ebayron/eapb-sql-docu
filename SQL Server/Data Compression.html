			<H2>Overview</H2>
			
				<P>
					A feature that reduces the storage space required for data by encoding it more efficiently.
					This can improve performance by reducing the amount of I/O operations needed to read and write data, as compressed data takes up less space on disk (compressed tables use extra CPU cycles to compress/decompress their contents).					
				</P>

				<P>
					There are two types of data compression available: row-level compression, which reduces storage for individual rows, and page-level compression, which compresses data at the page level, often achieving higher compression ratios.
					This applies for rowstore tables and indexes, and support columnstore and columnstore archival compression for columnstore tables and indexes.
				</P>
				
				<P>
					The idea is simple: Find repetitive sections of data in a table and store unique information just per row or page or column store index.
					Modern compression algorithms can reduce the on-disk footprint by 40-60% or even more, depending on the type of data.
				</P>
				
				<P>
					For rowstore tables and indexes, use the data compression feature to help reduce the size of the database.
					You can configure row and page compression on the following database objects:
				</P>

					<UL>
						<LI>A whole table that is stored as a heap.</LI>
						<LI>A whole table that is stored as a clustered index.</LI>
						<LI>A whole nonclustered index.</LI>
						<LI>A whole indexed view.</LI>
						<LI>For partitioned tables and indexes, you can configure the compression option for each partition, and the various partitions of an object don't have to have the same compression setting.</LI>
					</UL>
					
				<P>
					For columnstore tables and indexes, all columnstore tables and indexes always use columnstore compression and this isn't user configurable.
					Use columnstore archival compression to further reduce the data size for situations when you can afford extra time and CPU resources to store and retrieve the data.
					You can configure columnstore archival compression on the following database objects:
				</P>

					<UL>
						<LI>A whole columnstore table or a whole clustered columnstore index. Since a columnstore table is stored as a clustered columnstore index, both approaches have the same results.</LI>
						<LI>A whole nonclustered columnstore index.</LI>
						<LI>For partitioned columnstore tables and columnstore indexes, you can configure the archival compression option for each partition, and the various partitions don't have to have the same archival compression setting.</LI>
					</UL>
					
				<H3>Row Compression</H3>
				
					<P>Stores data types using only the bytes necessary for the value.</P>
					
						<UL>
							<LI>An int uses 4 Bytes of storage, whether it is 2 or 2,147,483,647. With row compression, 2 should 1 Byte of storage space.</LI>
							<LI>Trailing zeroes, padded, and blank charactes are not stored, where applicable.</LI>
						</UL>
					
				<H3>Page Compression</H3>
				
					<P>Prefix Compression</P>
					
						<UL>
							<LI>Prefix value selected for efficient storage.</LI>
							<LI>Storage values modified based on prefix values.</LI>
						</UL>
				
					<P>Eliminates redundant storage of repeated values.</P>				

			<H2>Implementation</H2>
			
				<OL>
					<LI>Estimate compression cost. A good rule of thumb is if you have lots of read, PAGE compression is the suggested option - ROW compression if you have lots of updates, deletes and inserts.</LI>

						<P>
							Note that "PARTITION = ALL" is specified.
							For a database that all tables are in a single partition, this is fine, though it could have been written as "PARTITION = 1" with the same result.
							Imagine, though, that you have very large tables that are partitioned.
							In such a case, it may be prudent to compress one partition at a time, rather than hogging the system while you compress all partitions at once.
