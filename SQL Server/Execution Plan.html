													<LI>This option focuses on optimizing the query itself to ensure that SQL Server can take advantage of existing indexes more effectively.</LI>
													<LI>Some possible ways to rewrite the query include:</LI>
														<OL>
															<LI>Adjusting WHERE conditions - Ensure that the query uses columns that are part of existing indexes, especially if the index is a covering index (ex: includes all the columns needed by the query).</LI>
															<LI>Change the order of filters - If there’s a composite index, reorder the conditions to match the left-to-right order of the columns in the index.</LI>
															<LI>Use proper joins and predicates - Refactor the query to leverage indexed columns for joins or filters.</LI>
														</OL>
													<LI>In many cases, rewriting the query might be a more efficient approach, especially if an existing index could be used with minor changes. This avoids adding extra indexes and keeps the database schema simpler.</LI>

											<LI>Rows are stored with a B-tree structure, enabling efficient seeks based on predicates.</LI>
											<LI>Used in Nested Loops Join when the inner input needs to be accessed multiple times with a filter.</LI>
										</OL>
									<LI><IMG SRC="IMG/47.PNG" WIDTH=2% /> Table Spool</LI>
										<OL>
											<LI>Stores intermediate results in a temporary table and fetches rows only when needed. This can reduce redundant computations for repeated accesses.</LI>

								<LI>Whenever you see Key Lookups, you could make your query fast by just adding the fields you need to the non-clustered index.

*********************************************
Table/Index Scan:

The database might perform a full table scan or index scan to locate the rows that need updating.

Impact: Full scans can be expensive; using appropriate indexes can reduce the scan cost.

Seek Operations:

If an index exists on the column(s) used in the WHERE clause, the database can perform an index seek to efficiently locate the rows.

Impact: Index seeks are more efficient than scans, especially for large tables.

Key Lookup (Bookmark Lookup/RID Lookup):

When an index seek finds the rows, a key lookup might be necessary to fetch the actual data from the table.

Impact: This can be costly if many rows are being updated; covering indexes can help avoid key lookups.

Clustered Index Update:

If the table has a clustered index, the update might involve modifying the clustered index.

Impact: Modifying the clustered index can be more expensive than a non-clustered index due to data reordering.

Non-Clustered Index Update:

Non-clustered indexes that include the updated columns will also need to be updated.

Impact: Multiple index updates can increase the cost of the operation.

DELETE Execution Plan
Table/Index Scan:

Similar to UPDATE, the database may perform a scan to find the rows to delete.

Impact: Full scans are costly; using indexes can improve efficiency.

Seek Operations:

Efficiently locating the rows to delete using an index seek.

Impact: Reduces the cost of locating rows compared to a full scan.

Key Lookup:

Fetching the actual data for deletion might require key lookups.

Impact: Can be costly for large numbers of rows; covering indexes can mitigate this.

Clustered Index Delete:

Deleting rows from a table with a clustered index requires updating the index.

Impact: Can be expensive due to data reordering.

Non-Clustered Index Delete:

Non-clustered indexes that include the deleted rows also need to be updated.

Impact: Increases the overall cost if multiple indexes are affected.

INSERT Execution Plan
Table Insert:

The database inserts new rows into the table.

Impact: Generally straightforward, but the presence of indexes can increase complexity.

Clustered Index Insert:

If the table has a clustered index, inserting a row might involve placing it in the correct order.

Impact: Can be more expensive than inserting into a heap due to the need for ordering.

Non-Clustered Index Insert:

Any non-clustered indexes that include the inserted columns must also be updated.

Impact: Multiple index updates can increase the cost of the insert operation.

Foreign Key Constraints:

Checking foreign key constraints can add to the cost if they involve additional lookups.

Impact: Ensures referential integrity but can slow down the insert operation.

Triggers:

If there are triggers on the table, they will execute as part of the insert operation.

Impact: Triggers can add significant overhead depending on their complexity.

Common Execution Plan Operators for DML
Nested Loops Join: Often used for small data sets but can become inefficient for larger sets.

Merge Join: Efficient for sorted data sets and large volumes.

Hash Join: Useful for unsorted large data sets, can be memory-intensive.

Sort: Indicates that the data needs to be sorted, which can be resource-intensive.

Filter: Applies filtering criteria, often seen with WHERE clauses.

Compute Scalar: Represents scalar computations, like calculations or function calls on a per-row basis.

Bitmap: Used to handle complex conditions and combine multiple criteria.

Optimizing DML Execution Plans
Indexes: Ensure appropriate indexes exist on columns used in WHERE clauses and join conditions to improve seek operations.

Statistics: Keep statistics up to date to help the query optimizer make better decisions.

Batch Processing: For large updates or deletes, consider processing in smaller batches to reduce locking and resource contention.

Covering Indexes: Design indexes that include all required columns to avoid key lookups.

Avoid Unnecessary Columns: Only update or insert necessary columns to minimize index updates and logging.

By analyzing and understanding execution plans, you can identify bottlenecks and optimize your DML operations for better performance.
*********************************************
regarding execution plans and indexes in sql server, if you encoutered an execution plan that shows an index scan, does that mean one of possible solutions is either you create a non clustered index for that query or you rewrite the query in such a way it will utilize one of the existing clusrtered index (for example, reordering the sort of data)?


ChatGPT said:
Yes, your understanding is correct! If you encounter an index scan in an execution plan, it typically means that SQL Server is scanning through the entire index (or table) to retrieve the required data. This often happens when:

No suitable index exists to quickly locate the data.

The query cannot utilize an existing index effectively.

Solutions:
Create a Non-Clustered Index
If the query frequently filters, sorts, or joins on certain columns, creating a non-clustered index on those columns can improve performance. For example:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_YourTable_Column1_Column2 
ON YourTable (Column1, Column2);
This would allow SQL Server to perform an index seek instead of a scan.

Rewrite the Query
If there is an existing clustered index or a non-clustered index that could be used, you might rewrite the query to take advantage of it. For example:

Adjust the sorting or filtering logic to align with the indexed columns.

Avoid unnecessary columns in SELECT (reducing the need for lookups).

Example:

Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM YourTable WHERE Column1 = @Value ORDER BY Column2;
Rewrite:
If the clustered index sorts data by Column2 and Column1:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM YourTable WHERE Column1 = @Value ORDER BY Column2 ASC;
When an Index Scan Is Acceptable
If the query needs to retrieve a large portion of the rows, an index scan might actually be more efficient than an index seek followed by lookups.

Avoid over-indexing: Having too many indexes can hurt performance during data modifications (inserts, updates, and deletes).

Steps to Troubleshoot:
Use SET STATISTICS IO ON to measure I/O.

Use the Database Engine Tuning Advisor to get index recommendations.

Analyze the missing index suggestions in the execution plan.
