			<H2>Overview</H2>

				<P>In Windows Server, "LooksAlive" and "IsAlive" are health check mechanisms used in clustering to determine the status of a resource.</P> 

			<H2>LooksAlive Health Check</H2>

				<OL>
					<LI>Runs every 5 seconds by default (can be changed by adjusting LooksAlivePollInterval property of Cluster service).</LI>
					<LI>A lightweight check to see if the resource appears to be operational.</LI>
					<LI>This check is not as thorough as the IsAlive check.</LI>
					<LI>The check will succeed if it passes a simple status check, such as if the service appears to be running (even though it might not be operational) or if a network connection is still up.</LI>
					<LI>If it fails, it calls "IsAlive" health check.</LI>
				</OL>
				

			<H2>IsAlive Health Check</H2>

				<OL>
					<LI>Runs every 60 seconds by default (can be changed by adjusting IsAlivePollInterval property of Cluster service).</LI>
					<LI>Performs more detailed check than LooksAlive to ensure the resource is fully operational.</LI>
					<LI>In general, check involves a more in-depth validation, such as querying the application for a response or performing a more extensive health check to ensure the resource can handle requests properly.</LI>
					<LI>For SQL Server resource:</LI>
						<OL>
							<LI>It checks and verifies the cached result of the internal IsAlive process in SQL Server resource DLL.</LI>
							<LI>It will run <CODE>SELECT @@SERVERNAME</CODE> to ensure that SQL Server is responding to queries (does not ensure that all user databases are operational).</LI>
							<LI>Retries 5 times to reconnect SQL Server.</LI>
							<LI>If all 5 retry fails, the SQL Server resource fails (internal IsAlive process shuts down the SQL server service) and a failover event is triggered.</LI>
						</OL>
				</OL>
