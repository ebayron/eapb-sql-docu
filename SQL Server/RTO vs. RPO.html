				<UL>
					<LI>RTO - This is the maximum acceptable amount of time that a system, application, or process can be down after a failure or disaster. It represents the target time to restore normal operations and minimize downtime.</LI>
					<LI>RPO - This is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. It refers to the point in time to which data must be recovered to resume normal operations, indicating how much data can be lost between backups or replications.</LI>
				</UL>

				<P>
					RTO and RPO are key concepts in DR and business continuity planning.
					Together, RTO and RPO help organizations determine their tolerance for downtime and data loss, guiding their disaster recovery strategies and infrastructure investments.</P>
