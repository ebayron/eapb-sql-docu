			<H2>CX Packet</H2>
			
If there is high CX Packet:

Query: SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks WHERE wait_type = 'CXPACKET'

In resource_description column, there is a node ID.

In the Execution Plan, one of the operators contains that node ID.

This way, you can figure out where in your plan the threads are waiting.

The goal is to never fix the CX Packet - it's to fix the stuff feeding it.

And there is a myth that fixing high CX Packet is to adjust max dop to 1. It will fix the wait, but server will perform poorer due to it cannot perform parallelism.
